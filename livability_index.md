# livabilty index

Creating a livability index involves combining multiple factors to generate a single score that reflects the overall quality of life in a city. Each factor should be normalized to a common scale, and weights should be assigned based on their relative importance. Here's a sample formula to calculate a livability index with factors such as AQI (Air Quality Index), water level, crime rate, and purchasing power parity:

\[ \text{Livability Index} = w_{\text{AQI}} \cdot \text{Normalized AQI} + w_{\text{Water}} \cdot \text{Normalized Water Level} + w_{\text{Crime}} \cdot \text{Normalized Crime Rate} + w_{\text{PPP}} \cdot \text{Normalized Purchasing Power Parity} + \ldots \]

Where:
- \( w_{\text{AQI}}, w_{\text{Water}}, w_{\text{Crime}}, w_{\text{PPP}}, \ldots \) are the weights assigned to each factor. The weights should add up to 1.
- \(\text{Normalized AQI}, \text{Normalized Water Level}, \text{Normalized Crime Rate}, \text{Normalized Purchasing Power Parity}, \ldots\) are the normalized values of each factor. Normalization is necessary to bring all factors to a common scale (usually between 0 and 1).

The normalization of each factor can be done using a min-max scaling formula:

\[ \text{Normalized Factor} = \frac{\text{Factor} - \text{Min Factor}}{\text{Max Factor} - \text{Min Factor}} \]

Where:
- \(\text{Factor}\) is the raw value of the factor for a city.
- \(\text{Min Factor}\) is the minimum value of that factor among all cities.
- \(\text{Max Factor}\) is the maximum value of that factor among all cities.

For example, let's assume you have the following weights for each factor:
- \( w_{\text{AQI}} = 0.2 \)
- \( w_{\text{Water}} = 0.3 \)
- \( w_{\text{Crime}} = 0.2 \)
- \( w_{\text{PPP}} = 0.3 \)

You would then normalize each factor using the min-max scaling formula and plug these values into the overall formula to get the livability index.

Keep in mind that the weights and normalization methods are subjective and should be determined based on the importance of each factor to the overall livability. Adjust the weights based on the priorities and preferences of the community or individuals involved in the index creation.
